# Classifying_human_physical_activities
With iWatch, fitbit and Google glass, wearable devices are prevalent in our daily lives.  A lot of data can be collected with these devices and a lot of interesting studies can be done with these data. My project attempts to classify human physical activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying with data from wearable device. 

I obtained my data from the UCI machine learning library. The data was collected through experiments by Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone. The experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. The experiment was video recorded and the data was labeled manually. 

I have built different machine learning models including randomforest, logistic regression, SVM and naive Bayes to classify the 6 types of human physical activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying. 

All the models (randomforest, logistic regression, SVM and naive Bayes) both the one vs. rest and multi-class have performed very well for the classification. Being able to differentiate human physical activities with data from wearable device has a lot of interesting applications. For example, a fitness app integrating calorie burns, physical therapy monitoring and applications in athletic training.
